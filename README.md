Overview of the project
In this project we will be analysing eye-tracking EEG data that was recorded during the Attention Network Task, a paradigm used to assess different components of attention. Each of the primary attention systems—alerting, orienting, and executive control monitoring—involves salient autonomic correlates as evidenced by changes in reactive pupil dilation and blinks (Geva et al. 2013).

In the eye-tracking data, several biological variables are measured:
Pupil dilation
Blinks
Saccades (quick, simultaneous movement of both eyes between two or more phases of fixation in the same direction)
